# The current progress
Currently, the project will be an ecommerce app with login in credentials to verify user.
It will use a database to state what the user has, can buy, and sell. It will have a component of the user where they will have a bank to spend and earn money in. The database will a car catalog.
## Possible aspects
- One possible aspect of the app is a game feature to earn money to buy from the catolog. The app will have both a black jack game and an easy puzzle game (for minor prizes). The objective is to earn money/points to buy the prizes (car). 
- The app will be able to show what's available. A search function can be done to find entries in the database.
- The usage of characters/numbers to navigate the app.
